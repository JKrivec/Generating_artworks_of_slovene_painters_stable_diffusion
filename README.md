# Generating artworks in selected styles of slovene painters using Stable Diffusion
This project contains an pure HTML/CSS/JS implementation of a web gallery.
The gallery presents the idea of the project and describes the selected three slovenian painters.
Those painters are Jo≈æef Tominc, Andrej Sternen and Ivan Grohar. Each section contains description of the author, authentic works
(some are marked, those were used for training the Stable Diffusion) and then the library of generated artwork in their style using Stable Diffusion
with previously trained embeddings.
You can find the Jupyter notebooks used to train the style and resulting trained embeddings in the Stable Diffusion folder inside the repository.

## Running the project
